Modify the existing Kendrapara Mart web app with the following STRICT requirements.
Do NOT add new frameworks, authentication, payments, or databases.

CORE GOAL
The website must show products and prices clearly.
WhatsApp must be used ONLY as the final order step with a pre-filled message.
The website itself is NOT an e-commerce checkout.

REQUIRED BEHAVIOR

1. Product & Price Display (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Show a clear product list on the website.
- Organize products by category:
  • Vegetables
  • Fruits
  • Groceries
  • Snacks & Cold Drinks
- Each product must display:
  • Product name
  • Unit (kg / piece / packet)
  • Price

2. Click Behavior Rules
- “What We Deliver” cards MUST be clickable.
- Clicking a category card scrolls to that category’s product list on the same page.
- “View Full Catalog” MUST NOT redirect to WhatsApp.
- “View Full Catalog” should scroll to the product list section.

3. WhatsApp Ordering Flow (FINAL STEP ONLY)
- Each product must have an “Add to Order” button.
- Clicking “Add to Order” adds the item to a temporary order list (frontend-only, no backend).
- A single “Order on WhatsApp” button should exist at the bottom.
- When clicked, WhatsApp opens with an auto-generated message containing:
  • Selected product names
  • Quantities
  • A placeholder for delivery location

Example WhatsApp message format:
Hello Kendrapara Mart,
I want to order:
- Tomato – 1 kg
- Potato – 2 kg

Delivery location:
(share Google Maps location)

4. Admin Simplicity
- Products and prices should be stored in a simple frontend structure (JSON or JS object).
- Prices must be easy to update without touching UI layout.
- Do NOT build an admin login or backend.

5. UX Rules
- Mobile-first layout.
- No popups.
- No redirects except WhatsApp.
- WhatsApp should NEVER open until the final “Order on WhatsApp” button is clicked.

6. Legal & Trust Notices
- Display clearly:
  • Cigarettes: 18+ only
  • Alcohol: Not delivered
  • Extra charges may apply for rain or night delivery

DO NOT DO
- Do not auto-open WhatsApp on page load.
- Do not redirect category clicks to WhatsApp.
- Do not add checkout, cart pages, or payment gateways.
- Do not add backend servers or databases.

DELIVERABLE
- A clean, working single-page application that:
  • Shows products & prices
  • Allows item selection
  • Sends the final order via WhatsApp only
