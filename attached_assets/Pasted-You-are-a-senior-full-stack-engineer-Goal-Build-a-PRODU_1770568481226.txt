You are a senior full-stack engineer.

Goal:
Build a PRODUCTION-READY admin panel for an existing grocery website “Kendrapara Mart”.
This admin panel must be HOSTED, SECURE, and AUTO-SYNC with the public website.
NO localStorage-only solutions. NO static JSON-only hacks.

Tech Stack (MANDATORY):
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: SQLite (file-based, hosted in Replit)
- Auth: Admin login (email + password, hashed)
- Frontend Admin UI: simple HTML/CSS/JS (or minimal React if needed)
- API-based architecture
- Public site fetches data via API (real-time updates)

Core Requirements:

1. AUTHENTICATION
- Admin login page (/admin/login)
- Secure session or JWT auth
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Protected admin routes
- Logout support

2. DATABASE SCHEMA
Create SQLite tables:
- admins (id, email, password_hash, created_at)
- products (
    id,
    name,
    category,
    price,
    unit,
    available (boolean),
    minQty,
    maxQty,
    stepQty,
    image_url,
    created_at,
    updated_at
)
- app_config (
    business_name,
    whatsapp_number,
    message_template,
    updated_at
)

3. ADMIN PANEL FEATURES
Admin Dashboard (/admin):
- Add product
- Edit product
- Delete product
- Toggle availability (In stock / Out of stock)
- Set min/max quantity
- Upload product image (image compression, WebP preferred)
- Manage WhatsApp number & message template
- Search & filter products
- Mobile-friendly UI

4. IMAGE HANDLING
- Image upload endpoint
- Compress images server-side
- Store images in /uploads
- Save image URL in database
- Validate file type & size

5. API ENDPOINTS
Public:
- GET /api/products
- GET /api/config

Admin (protected):
- POST /api/admin/login
- POST /api/admin/logout
- POST /api/admin/products
- PUT /api/admin/products/:id
- DELETE /api/admin/products/:id
- POST /api/admin/upload-image
- PUT /api/admin/config

6. PUBLIC SITE INTEGRATION
- Public website must fetch products via API
- Any admin change should reflect immediately on public site
- No rebuild, no redeploy needed for data changes

7. SECURITY
- Input validation
- XSS-safe outputs
- Auth middleware
- File upload protection
- No secrets exposed to frontend

8. PROJECT STRUCTURE
/server
  ├─ index.js
  ├─ db.sqlite
  ├─ auth.js
  ├─ routes/
  ├─ middleware/
  ├─ uploads/
/admin
  ├─ login.html
  ├─ dashboard.html
  ├─ admin.js
/public
  ├─ index.html
  ├─ app.js

9. DELIVERABLES
- Fully working Replit project
- Runs with one command: `npm start`
- Clear README with setup steps
- Default admin account created on first run

IMPORTANT RULES:
- This must work on Replit hosting (not localhost-only)
- Do NOT use localStorage as primary database
- Do NOT over-engineer (no Firebase, no Supabase)
- Keep it simple, clean, and reliable
- Assume this will later be moved to Hostinger/VPS

Output:
Generate the complete working codebase with explanations where necessary.
